Title: Implementing the Viterbi algorithm on trellises.

Team: Kristiina Oksner, Helena Sokk, Raido Rehepapp

The main idea is stated in the title. Given a trellis, to implement the Viterbi algorithm (dynamic programming). In addition, we want to write a method that can generate trellises from the generator matrix.

The Viterbi algorithm is used in coding theory. Implementing this algorithm will help people who are dealing with coding theory (even just students who are taking coding theory course). Besides the implementation, one of the challenges is the trellis itself. Not all of the students have encountered such a term, so trying to understand and implement it may be a challenge.
