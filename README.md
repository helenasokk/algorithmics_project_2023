Title: Implementing the Viterbi algorithm on trellises.
Team: Kristiina Oksner, Helena Sokk, Raido Rehepapp

The main idea is stated in the title. Given a trellis, to implement the Viterbi algorithm (dynamic programming). In addition, we want to write a method that can generate trellises from the generator matrix.
